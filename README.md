# NewsletterApi
ChatGPTNewsletterApi

This c# code is created by using ChatGPT. Of course in the end product I've added some additional code but the bulk of the code is the same.

The command I used for this code includes these:

Can you write me c# newsletter using .Net 6 Web api with controller which includes sending emails to all newsletter subscribers with smtp client by setting the text, 
adding and deleting subscribers. Include a newsletter service which this controller uses and use repository pattern. 
Use entityframework core and sqlserver as database and use code first approach. 

After the bulk code is created there were no emailsender to be present so I typed.

Can you create email sender for previous conversation and create the startup class for this newsletter api

Html code:

Can you create a html page for this newsletter api

Adding some style

Can you write this html code with bootstrap and make it appear in the middle of the page. Also make seperate pages for all endpoints.
